# algorithms and problem solving approach

## step 1 - understand the problem
ask yourself these questions:
1. can i restate the problem in my own words
2. what are the inputs that go into the problem
3. what are the outputs that should come from the solution
4. can the outputs be determined from the inputs (do i have enough information to solve the problem)
5. how should i label the important pieces ofdata that are a part of the problem


## step 2 - explore concrete examples
1. start with simple examples
2. progress to more complex examples
3. explore examples with empty inputs
4. explore examples with invalid inputs


## step 3 - break it down
- explicitly write out the steps you need to take -> use pseudocode
- this step is about seeing your process


## step 4 - solve/simplify
- if you get stuck on a difficult part of the problem, solve a simpler problem
- you want to have something that you can show for yourself
- you might gain insight into the harder part while doing the simpler stuff that you can incorporate back in later


## step 5 - look back and refactor
- make sure you talk about how you can improve on what you've written (what you like or dont like, ask these questions out loud)
