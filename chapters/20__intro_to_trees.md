# intro to trees
Trees:
a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship
- branching structure

lists are linear, whereas trees are **nonlinear** -> there're many different paths.

there are some rules though:
- a node can only point towards a child, they cant point towards a parent or a sibling
- there has to be one entry point (only one root)

### tree terminology
- **root**: the top node in a tree
- **child**: a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
- **parent**: the converse notion of a child
- **siblings**: a group of nodes with the same parent
- **leaf**: a node with no children
